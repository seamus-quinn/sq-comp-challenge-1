# sq-comp-challenge-1

This project is a work-profile for Nacho Libre.  It showcases each of his skills and/or values.  In the bio section, you have the ability to pray for him, or challenge him to a fight.  There are carousel buttons to scroll through his photos. The buttons are not functional.  There are also a couple hidden surprises. Here is a comparison of the two comps:
